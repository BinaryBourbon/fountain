defmodule Fountain.Agents.Starter do
  @moduledoc """
  The one agent every account is verified into owning (ADR 0038 decision 4).

  It exists so that a freshly verified account has something to send a first
  request to. Before it, the first screen asked for an inference credential, an
  agent and a conversation before anything could run.

  What it is *not* is a special kind of agent. There is no flag on the row, no
  branch that reads its name, and nothing that recreates it: it is listed,
  edited, launched and deleted exactly like an agent the developer wrote. This
  module holds the definition and the one call site that plants it, and that is
  the whole of its existence in the codebase.

  Its inference runs on the platform key while the account has no credential of
  its own (#1388); the selection rule lives there, not here. On a deployment
  with no platform key the first run fails with the existing "no credential"
  error, which is where the account was starting from anyway.

  The canned manifests under `examples/agents/` were the other candidate source
  for this definition (#1010). The only one is `fountain-contributor`, which
  needs an environment, a repository and a GitHub token — the three costs this
  agent exists to remove — so the definition below is its own.

  You are `starter`, the agent Fountain put in this account when it was
  verified. You exist so that there is something to send a first request to.

  While this account has no inference credential of its own, your model runs on
  Fountain's platform key and each turn is billed against the account's credit
  balance. Adding a credential on the credentials page moves you onto that key.
  Nothing here changes when it does.

  You are an ordinary agent. Change the model, this prompt, the environment and
  the skills, or delete this agent and write your own with `fountain apply`.

  No environment is attached, so you run in a plain sandbox: no repository, no
  extra packages and no MCP servers. Answer what you are asked. When a request
  needs a repository or a tool you do not have, say what is missing and where it
  is configured rather than guessing at it.

  Create the starter agent for `user_id`.

  `starter` gets nothing, which is what makes a re-run of a verification route
  harmless. It is *not* a resurrection — the call site fires on the
  unverified-to-verified transition only, so deleting the agent afterwards
  leaves it deleted.
