defmodule Fountain.Conversations.ExecutionTransport do
  @moduledoc """
  Owns one bounded command outside the conversation actor.

  Spawn intent precedes I/O. Only provider control metadata matching the returned
  command reference can bind identity; stdin remains closed to callers until
  that binding succeeds. Each write rechecks the durable journal. A failed or
  timed-out write retires the entire execution and is never replayed.

  Local task termination is not remote confirmation. Late identity can still
  make an expired spawn cleanable; after a bounded drain, unresolved intent stays
  in the journal. Public admission remains disabled pending released identity
  support and complete lifecycle integration.

  **Sprites only, and that is a real limit rather than a staging detail.**
  `_unsafe_start/5` refuses any other provider with `:provider_not_supported`,
  and admission rolls back the same way, because binding a provider-issued
  session id from trusted control metadata is a per-adapter capability and only
  the Sprites adapter has it. E2B, Daytona and self-hosted runners (ADR 0018,
  ADR 0022) therefore cannot carry a bounded turn at all. They get a refusal at
  admission, not a silently unbounded turn — a caller that asks for a limit and
  is told no is fine; one that asks and is ignored is not.

  The `:deadline` timer set in `init/1` is not the enforcement mechanism. It is
  a local convenience for a process that happens to still be alive; the
  guarantee is the absolute `deadline_at` on the journal row, which
  `ExecutionDeadlineWorker` acts on whether or not this process survived.
