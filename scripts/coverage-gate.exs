# Enforces the coverage threshold across the partitions' exports.
#
# This is `mix test.coverage` minus the part CI cannot use. That task spends
# roughly 90% of its time rendering an HTML report — 530 files and 129MB on
# this repo, ~17s of the coverage job — and nothing reads it: the job asserts a
# threshold and exits. Measured on the same six exports:
#
#     mix test.coverage    85.46%   7.4s wall / 18.7s user   (+129MB of HTML)
#     this script          85.46%   3.6s
#
# The number is identical, and that is the whole basis for using this instead.
# Two details of `:cover` have to be handled to make it so, and getting either
# wrong moves the total by percentage points rather than failing loudly:
#
#   * `:cover.analyse(mod, :coverage, :line)` returns one entry per *clause*,
#     so a line with several clauses appears several times. A line counts once,
#     and counts as covered if ANY clause on it ran. Summing the entries
#     instead reported 81.32% against the real 85.46% — under the threshold,
#     failing a build that should pass.
#   * Line 0 is module-level bookkeeping, not executable, and is dropped.
#
# It reads coverage.exs, so `:ignore_modules` and the threshold stay in the one
# place `mix test.coverage` and `mix test --cover` already read them from.
#
# Run it as `elixir scripts/coverage-gate.exs`, not through `mix run`. It reads
# .coverdata and coverage.exs and touches nothing else — no deps, no _build, no
# app modules — so mix has nothing to contribute and a great deal to do first:
# through `mix run` the step recompiled the app ("Compiling 10 files") for a
# script that never calls it, which was most of its 12s in CI.
#
# Elixir is pinned (.tool-versions), so these semantics cannot drift without a
# deliberate bump. WHEN BUMPING ELIXIR, re-run `mix test.coverage` on the same
# exports and check the totals still agree.
