# 0015 — Fountain as an ACP agent, reachable from a code editor

**Status:** Accepted — **gates 1–3 are built.** `fountain acp` exists in
`cli/internal/acp`, and an editor can open a conversation on a Fountain agent,
prompt it, watch it stream, cancel it, and reopen it later
([#709](https://github.com/BinaryBourbon/fountain/issues/709): gate 1 in
#710/#711/#712, gate 2 in #713/#714/#715, gate 3 in #718 and the PR carrying
this line). **Gate 4 — permission forwarding — is built** (#708, in
the PR carrying this line): a `session/request_permission` raised in the sprite
reaches the editor as the ACP request it already is, and the answer travels
back down. The question the *Consequences* section said to answer first was
answered in 0014 gate 3 and is summarised there.

**A third client validated the reusability bet — see the
[2026-08-16 addendum](#addendum--2026-08-16-openclaw-is-another-acp-client-spike-verified):
[OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) drives `fountain acp` as a custom ACP
harness, no new architecture, docs at
[`integrations/openclaw.md`](https://github.com/BinaryBourbon/fountain/blob/main/docs/integrations/openclaw.md).**

This is the second of two ADRs about the Agent Client Protocol and covers the
opposite direction from [0014](0014-agent-client-protocol.md).

What the build changed about the design as written, all recorded in the gates
below: the ACP session id **is** the conversation id rather than a minted one,
because an editor must be able to hand back an id from last week; the sandbox
paths in `tool_call.locations` are removed rather than labelled, because the
protocol has no way to say "this path is on another machine"; and the adapter
turned out to be a forwarder rather than a translator, which is the best case
this ADR hoped for from 0014 and the reason it stayed small.

## Context

[0014](0014-agent-client-protocol.md) proposes Fountain as an ACP **client**,
talking to the coding-agent CLIs it already runs inside sprites. This ADR is
about the other end: making a Fountain conversation reachable from an editor,
with Fountain itself as the ACP **agent**.

The two are complements, not alternatives. Taken together they make Fountain
an **ACP proxy** — the same block vocabulary arriving from a sprite on one
side and leaving for an editor on the other. That symmetry is the central
insight of this ADR, and it is also the source of its one hard dependency
(see *Dependency on 0014*).

### The shape, drawn

This ADR is the upper half of the picture; [0014](0014-agent-client-protocol.md)
is the lower half. Both are drawn here so that neither is read as a tree with
the other hanging off it — they are two protocol roles held by one process.

```

Three things the boxes are there to make hard to misread.

**`fountain acp` is a local subprocess of the editor, not a network peer of
the server.** The editor spawns it and speaks ACP down a pipe; the HTTP+SSE
hop happens on the far side of that process. This is where authentication and
multi-account selection stay, and it is why the remote transport is declined
below rather than treated as the obvious future.

**The web UI is a peer client, not a legacy one.** Two surfaces render the
same conversation from the same stream — that is the *Team visibility* bullet
below, and it is also why the stream picks up interface obligations under
*Consequences*.

**The workspace is at the bottom of the diagram.** The editor is the only box
on it that has no files in play. Any picture that runs a line straight from an
editor to a remote agent invites exactly the misreading that
*the impedance mismatch* section exists to prevent, and that v1 answers by
declaring no client `fs/*` or `terminal/*` capabilities at all.

Placement — which sandbox platform runs the sprite, and in whose cloud — is
deliberately absent. It is an axis neither ADR touches: ACP unifies the leaves,
not the substrate.

### Why an editor would want this rather than a local agent

An editor can already spawn Claude Code or Codex locally. Fountain is worth
reaching for only where a local subprocess cannot go, and there are five
places:

- **The work outlives the editor.** `ConversationServer` and the rehydrator
  already keep a turn running when nothing is attached. Close the laptop, the
  turn continues; reopen, reattach.
- **Conversations are addressable and persistent.** A transcript, turn
  history, and an audit trail (0013) that outlive any editor session.
- **Fan-out.** `X-Fountain-Parent-Conversation-Id` and
  `GET /api/conversations/:id/tree` mean one editor session can start and
  enumerate N sub-conversations. No local agent subprocess does this.
- **The unit is a Fountain agent, not a raw CLI.** The editor picks something
  that already has an environment, vault overrides, skills and MCP servers
  provisioned — and inference credentials that never touch the developer's
  machine.
- **Team visibility.** The same conversation is open in the web UI for anyone
  with access, while it runs.

### What already exists to build on

The Go CLI (`cli/`, ~5.5k lines) is already an HTTP+SSE client for exactly
this API, with the hard parts done:

- `GET /api/conversations/:conversation_id/stream` is a real SSE endpoint —
  resumable via `Last-Event-ID`, heartbeated, filterable by `?streams=`, and
  it publishes a terminal stage when a conversation server dies rather than
  heartbeating into the void (`conversation_controller.ex:495-650`).
- `cli/internal/cmd/stream.go` already consumes it with reconnect, backoff and
  idle-timeout handling, and already classifies terminal outcomes
  (`errTurnFailed`, `errProvisionFailed`, `errSandboxExpired`) — which is
  precisely the classification an ACP stop reason needs.
- `fountain auth login` and `~/.fountain/credentials` already solve
  authentication.
- `cli-release-go.yml` already ships four platform binaries per tag.

Adding one subcommand to a binary that is already installed, authenticated and
distributed is a materially smaller proposition than anything in 0014.

### The impedance mismatch, which is the whole design problem

ACP assumes the agent runs as a subprocess of the editor and edits **the
editor's** files — that is why `fs/read_text_file` and `fs/write_text_file`
are *client*-provided (so the agent sees unsaved buffer state), and why
`tool_call.locations` exists for the editor to follow along.

A Fountain agent edits a **sprite's** filesystem, on a repo the sprite cloned.
The developer's working copy is a different machine. Every design that
pretends otherwise produces an agent that appears to be editing the open
project and is not.

## Decision

Build **`fountain acp`**: a subcommand of the existing Go binary that speaks
ACP over stdio to an editor and HTTP+SSE to the Fountain API. The editor
spawns it exactly as it spawns any other ACP agent.

Deliberately *not* ACP's remote (HTTP/WebSocket) transport, which the protocol
introduction documents as work in progress. Local stdio is the stable,
universally implemented transport; it needs no inbound network path to the
developer's machine, and it puts authentication in the one place that already
handles it. Confirm the remote transport's status at build time, but do not
design for it.

### The workspace question: a control surface, not a workspace

**v1 declares no client filesystem or terminal capabilities and requests
none.** The editor is where you watch, steer, interrupt and fan out a remote
conversation — not where its files live. `tool_call.locations` are emitted as
explicitly sprite-side paths, labelled as such, so an editor cannot mistake
them for local ones.

This is a real product limit, stated rather than hidden. The two escalations
past it are separate decisions and must not be smuggled in through a protocol
adapter:

- **Read-through** — the editor opens a file the agent touched. Needs a new
  server endpoint to read a file out of a sandbox (`POST /api/conversations/
  :id/read` is mark-as-read, not file read — nothing like this exists today),
  plus tenant scoping and a path-traversal story for paths that arrive from a
  sandbox we do not fully control.
- **Workspace sync** — mirroring the local checkout into the sprite and diffs
  back. This is Fountain becoming a remote-development product. It deserves
  its own ADR and its own answer to "what happens on conflict".

### Protocol mapping

| ACP | Fountain |
|---|---|
| `initialize` | capability declaration; `authMethods` points at `fountain auth login` |
| `authenticate` | existing API key from `~/.fountain/credentials` |
| `session/new` | `POST /api/conversations` for a chosen agent |
| `session/load` | replay `GET .../stream` from `Last-Event-ID: 0` |
| `session/prompt` | `POST .../prompts`, then block on the stream until a terminal stage |
| `session/update` | translated stream events (see below) |
| `session/cancel` | `POST .../interrupt` |
| stop reason | the terminal-outcome classification `stream.go` already computes |

`session/prompt` must block and return a stop reason, while Fountain's API is
post-then-stream. The adapter therefore correlates the prompt response with
the terminal stage event on the SSE stream — the same correlation `stream.go`
performs today to give `fountain run` a truthful exit code (#398).

### Dependency on 0014

**The SSE stream carries raw runtime stdout.** `LogEvent.data` is the CLI's
own stream-json, forwarded verbatim (`conversation_controller.ex` `write_event`
over `_unsafe_list_log_events`). So an ACP agent built on today's API would
have to parse four proprietary dialects to emit `session/update` — and those
parsers already exist, in Elixir, in a LiveView (`show.ex:1340-1530`).

Writing a second copy in Go is the one outcome this ADR exists to prevent: two
implementations of four undocumented formats, in two languages, drifting.

So this work is **gated on normalization happening server-side**, which is
what 0014 produces. In the best case it is nearly free: once Fountain is an
ACP client of the sprite, it is holding ACP blocks already, and
`fountain acp` forwards rather than translates. Fountain becomes a proxy and
the dialects stop at the server boundary — which is exactly where they should
stop, since that is the only place that knows which runtime produced them.

If 0014 stalls, the fallback is a normalized event kind on the stream
(`?streams=blocks`) emitted by the server from the same Elixir parsers. Either
way the translation happens once, in Elixir. **A dialect parser must never
land in `cli/`.**

### Gates

1. ~~**Transcript-only prototype, one runtime.**~~ **Built.** `fountain acp`
   renders a live remote conversation: message chunks, thoughts, tool calls
   with status. No `fs/*`, no `terminal/*`. Verified against prod, not only in
   tests — the run returned a tool call and a real stop reason.
2. ~~**Session lifecycle.**~~ **Built.** `session/load`, `session/cancel`,
   stop reasons taken from the sandbox's own adapter, and survival across a
   dropped SSE connection. Verified live: a cancel answered a blocked prompt
   with `cancelled` in 0.1s, and a load replayed 31 updates before responding.
3. ~~**Auth and distribution.**~~ **Built.** `authMethods`, the editor page in
   `docs/integrations/editors.md`, and the event stream documented as the
   interface it now is (#707).
4. ~~**Permission forwarding.**~~ **Built.** Under an `ask` policy the request
   goes to the editor with the agent's own options, and the answer returns
   through `POST /api/conversations/:id/requests/:request_id` (#708). Every
   unclear outcome denies with a rejection the agent itself offered, which
   covers the detached editor the *Consequences* section worried about.
   `--permission` turns asking on for an editor entry, because an agent's
   default is `auto_allow` and would otherwise raise nothing to forward.

**Two things found by running gates 1–3 against production, which the tests
could not see.** Both are worth keeping here because they are properties of
this design, not accidents. The filtered *replay* of the event stream had
never included the `acp` stream, so `session/load` returned an empty
transcript and every mid-turn reconnect silently dropped what it missed
(#716) — a proxy that forwards stored events depends on the store's filter as
much as on the protocol. And a lost wake race leaves a conversation pointing
at a sandbox it just terminated (#717), which this adapter reproduces on every
session because `session/new` and the first `session/prompt` arrive a second
apart.

**On the remote transport, which this gate said to revisit:** ACP's own
introduction still documents it as work in progress, and nothing in the build
argued for waiting. The local process kept earning its place — it is where
`fountain auth login`'s credentials already are, and where the instance and
profile are chosen.

## Consequences

**Permission requests traverse two hops.** A
`session/request_permission` originating in the sprite is forwarded
editor-ward and answered back down: sprite → Fountain → editor → Fountain →
sprite. This section said not to start gate 4 without an answer to *what
replies when the editor detaches mid-request*, and it was right to.

> **Answered, and built 2026-08-22 (#708).** The answer is two-layered, and
> the outer layer belongs to 0014 gate 3 rather than to this adapter: a
> permission timeout well under the idle bound, whose expiry is **deny**. So a
> conversation cannot block forever on a prompt nobody will see, whoever was
> supposed to answer it, and the reaper needs to know nothing new.
>
> The detached editor is the case this adapter adds, and it is
> *distinguishable* from nobody-attached — so it does not wait for that
> timeout. An editor that errors, disconnects, or dismisses the prompt denies
> the call immediately, with a `reject_*` the agent itself offered. An option
> id the agent never advertised is refused rather than relayed, and when the
> agent offered no rejection at all nothing is sent, because inventing one is
> the failure the never-synthesise rule exists to prevent. The web apps are
> **peer clients** of the same request; first answer wins, and a 409 is an
> ordinary outcome rather than an error.

**Two clients now depend on the event stream's shape.** The web UI and the ACP
adapter would render from the same normalized events. That is the point — but
it means the stream stops being an implementation detail of `show.ex` and
becomes an interface, with the compatibility obligations of one. It belongs in
the OpenAPI spec and under the router-walking guard test added by the #531
campaign.

**We would be shipping an editor integration, with editor bug reports.** ACP
clients differ in what they render and how they handle a slow agent. Support
surface grows in a direction the team has no experience with, and "it doesn't
work in $EDITOR" lands in our tracker regardless of whose bug it is.

**The stdio proxy is not throwaway work.** Even if ACP's remote transport
stabilises and editors can point at a URL, the local process is where
credentials, workspace policy and multi-account selection live. It stays.

**What we give up:** the simplicity of Fountain having exactly one interactive
surface. Today the web UI is the product; the CLI is a script tool. An editor
integration is a third first-class surface with its own expectations about
latency and interactivity — a conversation that takes four seconds to
provision a sandbox reads very differently inside an editor than on a web page
that showed a spinner and a log.

## Alternatives considered

- **Do nothing; keep the web UI as the only interactive surface.** Defensible.
  Rejected as the default because the editor is where the developer already
  is, and every advantage listed above is one Fountain already has built and
  currently exposes only through a browser tab.
- **Wait for ACP's remote transport and expose ACP directly from Phoenix.**
  Removes the local binary entirely and is architecturally cleaner. Rejected
  as a *starting point*: the transport is documented as WIP, and it would put
  auth and multi-account selection into the protocol layer rather than into
  the CLI that already solves both. Revisit at gate 3.
- **A bespoke editor extension per editor.** Maximum control, and the way to
  get true workspace sync. Rejected: it is the N×M problem ACP exists to
  delete, and we would be paying it from the wrong side after arguing the
  opposite in 0014.
- **Build this before 0014.** Tempting — it is smaller, more visible, and the
  CLI already does most of it. Rejected because the only way to emit
  `session/update` from today's API is to reimplement four dialect parsers in
  Go, which is strictly worse than the status quo it would be fixing.

## Addendum — 2026-08-16: OpenClaw is another ACP client (spike verified)

The bet this ADR made — that being an ACP *agent* means any ACP *client* can
drive a Fountain agent, not just the editors named in the gates — paid out a
third time. After Zed (the editor gates) and [Buzz](0020-buzz-as-a-client-of-the-acp-gateway.md)
(an ACP-native harness), [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) — a self-hosted
assistant that fronts chat surfaces (Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal) and
routes them to coding harnesses over ACP — reaches Fountain through the **same
`fountain acp` adapter, with no code change on our side.** OpenClaw's `acpx`
plugin supports a custom-command harness, so registering Fountain is a config
block:

```json5
plugins: { entries: { acpx: { enabled: true, config: {
  agents: { fountain: { command: "fountain", args: ["acp", "--agent", "researcher"] } },
  permissionMode: "approve-all"
}}}}
```

Then `/acp spawn fountain` from a channel, or a `bindings[]` entry pinning a
channel to it. The integration page is
[`docs/integrations/openclaw.md`](https://github.com/BinaryBourbon/fountain/blob/main/docs/integrations/openclaw.md).

**What was proven.** OpenClaw's custom-command harness is, mechanically, a Node
child-process spawn plus line-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio, with the host
environment inherited. That contract was reproduced exactly — an acpx-identical
client spawning `fountain acp --agent acp-proof-659` against production — and it
drove `initialize → session/new → session/prompt` to completion: a real
conversation, provisioned in a sandbox, streaming the agent's reply back as
`agent_message_chunk` updates and ending on a real stop reason. `authMethods`
came back empty (already authenticated from the inherited `~/.fountain/
credentials`), so the client skipped `authenticate` as a well-behaved one does.
The load-bearing half — *a generic ACP client can spawn `fountain acp` and drive
a live turn, with auth flowing from the host env* — is demonstrated, not
asserted.

Worth naming: the reply path is **simpler than the editor case**. There is no
impedance mismatch to manage from a chat surface — no open project to confuse a
sandbox path with — so the "control surface, not a workspace" limit this ADR
argues for lands as a natural fit rather than a stated constraint, and the reply
returns over ACP's own `agent_message_chunk` stream with no publish step.

**Update — 2026-08-16: the acpx smoke ran, on Node 24. Residual #1 is closed.**
Against the **real acpx binary (v0.11.2)** — the engine OpenClaw's gateway drives
harnesses with — both registration paths drove `fountain acp` to a real reply
from agent `acp-proof-659`: the `--agent` escape hatch
(`acpx --agent "fountain acp --agent …" exec …` → `OPENCLAW-SMOKE-OK`) and a
named agent resolved from acpx's `agents` config map
(`{command, args}` → `OPENCLAW-CONFIG-OK`). Env inheritance is confirmed —
`fountain` was found on PATH and authenticated from the inherited
`~/.config/fountain/credentials`, with no secret in the acpx config. And
OpenClaw's `acpx` plugin config schema (`openclaw.plugin.json`) declares
`plugins.entries.acpx.config.agents.<id> = { command (required), args }` and a
`permissionMode` enum including `approve-all` — exactly the block the docs page
ships. Node ≥ 22.22.3 was the only gate, and Node 24.19.0 cleared it; simulating
`acpx` beforehand was the faithful move, and running the real binary confirmed
it rather than overturning it.

**Update — 2026-08-16 (later): the gateway round trip is green.** A live
`--dev` gateway daemon (OpenClaw 2026.7.1, acpx 0.11.2) ran
`openclaw agent` → OpenClaw's own brain → `sessions_spawn(runtime: "acp",
agentId: "fountain")` → acpx → `fountain acp` → sandbox → reply relayed back,
against production. Two things had to change in the adapter, both about
**session controls OpenClaw pushes at spawn** — its brain sends the model it
chose (`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5-…`) as a `sessions_spawn` argument, OpenClaw
derives a `thinking` level from it, and acpx delivers both over
`session/set_config_option`, treating any rejection as fatal:

- [#759](https://github.com/BinaryBourbon/fountain/pull/759) implemented the
  method as accept-but-do-not-apply (the agent's model is authoritative — the
  same reason `session/set_model` is absent).
- [#760](https://github.com/BinaryBourbon/fountain/issues/760): that reply must
  **not** carry a `configOptions` list. acpx narrows the controls it will send
  to whatever list the last reply advertised, so the honest list — empty, or the
  fixed model alone — makes the *next* control fail with "does not advertise
  config option 'thinking'" and the turn dies anyway. `fountain acp` therefore
  advertises no session config options at all (`session/new` never did) and
  answers `set_config_option` with `_meta.fountain.applied: false`. Advertising
  `thinking`/`fast` to satisfy the check was considered and rejected: a
  Fountain agent has neither, and saying otherwise is the "describes unbuilt
  behaviour" failure this repo's guidance forbids.

One cost is OpenClaw's, and stays: a `mode: "run"` spawn ensures the acpx
session twice (spawn init, then turn) and one-shot acpx answers each with a
fresh `session/new`, so every gateway spawn opens **two** Fountain
conversations and prompts one; the orphan sits `pending` with a provisioned
sandbox until the idle reaper parks it. Documented on the integration page;
worth an upstream report, not an adapter workaround.

**What is still open.**

- **A channel binding remains unproven.** The round trip above was driven from
  `openclaw agent` (the CLI front door to the gateway); a Telegram/Discord
  binding is the same gateway path with a delivery step on the end, and has not
  been run.
- **Permission forwarding was gate 4 / #643,** and is built (#708). Nothing in
  this addendum was what unblocked it.
  OpenClaw runs the turn under `permissionMode: "approve-all"` and the sandbox's
  own policy; per-tool approvals do not round-trip to a channel any more than
  they do to an editor. The two-hop failure mode in *Consequences* applies
  unchanged, and this addendum is more reason to answer it, not less.
- **One identity per host.** OpenClaw is single-user, so every session
  authenticates as the host's Fountain login. Per-channel-user identities are
  out of scope.

This addendum records a proven adapter, a config-only path verified against
the real acpx binary, and a green gateway-daemon round trip — but not a channel
binding, and not permission forwarding. It does not alter the decision or the gates; it is
evidence for the central claim that the dialects stop at the server boundary and
every ACP client past it is the same forwarder.
