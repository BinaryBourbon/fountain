/**
 * Sit in front of an agent and approve its tool calls one at a time.
 *
 * The agent needs an `ask` entry in its `permission_policy` — the default is
 * `auto_allow`, which never asks. `execute` is the one worth holding, because
 * it is the kind that runs commands:
 *
 *   await fountain.agents.update("<agent>", {
 *     permission_policy: { execute: "ask", default: "auto_allow" },
 *   });
 *
 *   FOUNTAIN_API_KEY=... node examples/permissions.ts "<agent>"
 *
 * Answer promptly. A request that expires is denied, and the turn carries on
 * without that step — so ignoring these is not the same as allowing them.
