  The help topic list against what is actually on disk.

  There used to be two hand-maintained copies of this list — one in
  `HelpLive.Show`, one in `LlmsController`, with a comment on the second saying
  "keep them in sync". They were not: `/llms.txt` advertised
  `/help/secrets-managers`, which the in-app list did not know, so following the
  link flashed "No such help topic" and redirected. The reverse hole existed
  too — `skills` was in the nav and missing from the bundle.

  One list now, and these check it in both directions so the next drift is a
  test failure rather than a dead link.
