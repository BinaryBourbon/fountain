defmodule Fountain.PermissionPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  The Fountain half of a `permission_policy` map (#1635).

  `Managoat.ACP.Permissions` owns the tool half: a key is a tool title or an
  ACP kind, a value is one of the three verdicts, and `"default"` covers the
  rest. That library reads every key it is given as a tool, so a key that is
  not one has to be taken out before the map reaches it. This module owns the
  taking out, and the one such key that exists.

  ## `ask_timeout`

  How long a request that outlived its turn waits, in seconds. Only detached
  requests read it. A request held inside a running turn keeps the global
  `:permission_ask_timeout_seconds` ceiling, which has to stay under the idle
  bound because the turn holding it defers idle reclaim
  (`Fountain.Conversations.Lifecycle.ask_timeout_ms/0`). A detached request
  holds nothing open, so that reasoning does not reach it and the value may
  be days.

  ## The ceiling, and what it is not

  `seconds/1` refuses anything above `max_ask_timeout_seconds/0` (365 days).
  That is **not** a quieter copy of the idle bound: the idle bound is minutes
  and exists because a held request keeps a sandbox from parking, which a
  detached request does not do. This ceiling exists because the value ends up
  in `turns.permission_deadline`, and a `timestamp` stops at 294276 AD — an
  `ask_timeout` of 1e15 seconds produced a year-31690765 deadline that
  Postgrex refused to encode, raising inside the `handle_info` that detaches
  the request and leaving the turn `running` with the request neither
  detached nor denied.

  One parser, so both halves of the bound get it: the tenant's `ask_timeout`
  here, and the sandbox's own `_meta.fountain.timeout` through
  `Fountain.Conversations.DetachedRequest.timeout_seconds/1`. A year is
  further out than anything this feature is for, so the refusal reads as a
  typo caught rather than as a limit imposed.

  ## Narrowing

  A launch policy may only narrow the agent's, and the same rule applies
  here: a **shorter** wait is the stricter one, because the tool is refused
  sooner. `effective_ask_timeout_seconds/2` takes the smaller of the two, and
  `check_narrows/2` refuses a launch that asks for a longer one.
