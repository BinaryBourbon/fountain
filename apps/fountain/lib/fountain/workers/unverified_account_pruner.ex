defmodule Fountain.Workers.UnverifiedAccountPruner do
  @moduledoc """
  Deletes accounts that registered and never verified their email (#258).

  An unverified account can authenticate but reaches nothing: the session is
  held on `/auth/verify-pending`, and the API refuses to mint or accept a key
  (#533). So after the grace period they are rows, not users. They are not free rows
  either: each carries a wrapped DEK, they distort every metric that counts
  `users`, and 158 of them were briefly mistaken for a 159-person legacy trial
  cohort (see `Fountain.Release.expire_legacy_trials/1`). The steady inflow is
  drive-by/bot registration (#259).

  Deletion goes through `Accounts.Deletion.delete_user/2` — the same teardown
  as self-serve and admin deletion (Stripe cancellation first, sprites, audit
  row) — never a bare `DELETE`. A registration-time Stripe trial subscription
  (#244) is therefore cancelled rather than left to fire trial-ending emails
  at an address that never asked for them.

  Config:

    * `:unverified_prune_after_days` — grace period, default 30. An account
      that verifies at any point is never touched; the window only has to be
      longer than "signed up, verified a while later". `0` disables the sweep.
    * `:unverified_prune_exempt` — substrings; an email containing any of
      them is never pruned, case-insensitively. For operator/test accounts
      that deliberately stay unverified.
