defmodule Fountain.Funnel do
  @moduledoc """
  Lifecycle funnel: registered → verified → onboarded → activated → funded.

  Admin-only aggregates (no tenant scoping — callers are the admin panel and
  the metrics poller). Answers three operator questions:

  - `summary_admin/0` — how many users reach each stage, the conversion from
    the previous stage, and the median time between stages.
  - **time to first reply** — verification to the first reply, median and p90,
    plus the share of accounts that get there inside a day. This is the number
    ADR 0038 says the onboarding redesign is judged on.
  - included stall breakdown — of the users who verified but never got a
    reply, how far did they get? This is the "40 verified, nothing created"
    question: did they add a credential, create an environment, write an agent
    of their own, start a conversation that never answered, or bounce straight
    off?

  Stage definitions:

  - **registered** — a `users` row exists
  - **verified** — `email_verified_at` set
  - **onboarded** — `onboarding_completed_at` set, and since #1393 that stamp
    is the whole of it. The `onboarding_state` column beside it was the
    wizard's position; the wizard went in #867, after which the column only
    distinguished `step_1` from `completed`, so it is dropped.
    `Fountain.Activation` stamps the date at the first reply (ADR 0038).
    `added_credential` / `built_environment` / `built_own_agent` are the
    stall breakdown's live signal.
  - **activated** — **the first conversation with a reply** (ADR 0038): the
    earliest `turns` row for the account carrying a non-empty `reply_text`.
    A conversation that never answered does not count, and neither does a
    sandbox that was provisioned for one. Until #1392 this stage was the
    union of a `conversations` row and a `sandbox_provisioned` usage event,
    which counted an attempt as an outcome; the union survives one stage
    down, in `stalled.started`, where "started something and got nothing" is
    exactly what it witnesses.
  - **funded** — holds a positive credit balance (ADR 0031). Comped accounts
    are operator-granted, not conversions, and are excluded; an account that
    spent its balance to zero drops out of this stage (a churn view is #286's
    job).

  Everything is computed from one pass over `users` plus a handful of grouped
  min queries — O(users) in memory, which is fine well past 10k users; push
  the math into SQL if that stops being true.
