defmodule FountainWeb.Plugs.Audit do
  @moduledoc """
  Records state-changing API requests to the audit log on the way out.

  Captures:
    * `action`: HTTP verb + the matched *route pattern* (e.g.
      `POST /api/conversations`, `DELETE /api/environments/:environment_id/secrets/:id`).
      The pattern, not the request path: see "Why the pattern and not the path".
    * `resource_type`, `resource_id`: derived from the matched route's
      action + params.
    * `actor`: derived from the credential — `"sprite"` for a per-conversation
      callback token, `"api"` otherwise. Previously hardcoded to `"api"`, which
      made a human, a CI job and an agent running inside a sandbox
      indistinguishable in the trail.
    * `request_ip`: from `conn.remote_ip`.
    * `metadata`: response status code.

  Read methods (GET) are not audited — they're noisy and rarely
  interesting. Failures (4xx/5xx) are still recorded so we can see
  rejected attempts.

  ## Why this stays, now that contexts audit themselves

  #540 moved semantic auditing into the context functions, which means an API
  mutation now writes two rows: `agent.updated` from `Agents.update_agent/3`,
  and `PUT /api/agents/:id` + status from here. That looked like something to
  clean up, and the decision was to keep both — they answer different
  questions:

    * the context event says **what changed** — a semantic action, the fields
      that moved, the resource;
    * this plug says **what was attempted** — verb, path, and the status code,
      including for requests that were refused. A 403 on a route whose context
      never ran leaves no semantic event at all, and a run of them is the
      signal you actually want.

  Scoping this down to "only routes whose context does not audit yet" was the
  alternative, and it was rejected: that list would be a second place to
  remember, one forgotten entry away from a silently unaudited route — the
  exact failure mode #540 existed to remove.

  Recorded as a decision in ADR 0013 §4 — two rows per API mutation is
  intended, and deduplicating them in the UI would lose the refused requests.

  ## Why the pattern and not the path

  This used to record `conn.request_path` verbatim, which put the resource id
  inside the action string: `POST /api/conversations/<uuid>/read` was a
  different action from the same call against a different conversation. Two
  things break when it does.

  The trail loses its only groupable field. "Show me every read of a
  conversation" is a `LIKE` over a column that has one distinct value per
  conversation, and the id is already in `resource_id` where a query can use
  it.

  And `Fountain.Analytics` mirrors `action` straight through as the **PostHog
  event name**. One event definition per uuid is unbounded cardinality in a
  third-party project that never garbage-collects definitions — the Fountain
  project had already grown `POST /api/conversations/<uuid>/read`,
  `POST /api/team/<uuid>/messages` and `POST /api/mcp/team/<uuid>` as separate
  events by the time anyone looked at the taxonomy.

  The route pattern is what both want. `Phoenix.Router.route_info/4` gives it
  exactly, from the same match the request already went through. When there is
  no router on the conn or the path does not match a route — neither happens
  on a live request that reached this pipeline, but both happen in a unit test
  that builds a bare conn — uuid-shaped segments are masked to `:id` instead,
  so the fallback is bounded too.
