// once: it encodes #398, where treating io.EOF as success made the CLI report
// a finished turn while the agent was still working. A second copy in the ACP
// adapter would be a second chance to reintroduce that, in the surface where
// it is hardest to notice — an editor showing a conversation that quietly
// stopped updating.
//
// What the loop does NOT decide is what an event *means*. Callers pass a
// Handler, because the CLI wants exit codes and human lines while the ACP
// adapter wants protocol notifications and a stop reason.
