  ## Key functions

  - `register_user/1` — email+password registration; also creates a UserDataKey
  - `authenticate_user/2` — verify email + password for login
  - `get_user_by_email/1` — lookup by email
  - `get_user/1` / `get_user!/1` — lookup by id
  - `verify_email/1` — set email_verified_at on the user
  - `reset_password/2` — update password hash + bump session_version
  - `create_api_key/2` — issue a new API key (returns the plaintext once)
  - `revoke_api_key/2` — permanently invalidate a key
  - `get_user_by_api_key/1` — authenticate a raw API key string
  - `touch_api_key/1` — update last_used_at (best-effort, off the request)
  - `upsert_oauth_user/3` — find-or-create user from OAuth callback

  ## API keys

  @doc """
  Generate and persist a new API key for `user_id` with the given human-readable `name`.

  The raw key is `"ftn_" <> 64 hex chars`. It is returned once and never stored.
  Only the SHA-256 hash and the first 8-character prefix are persisted.

  Minting is audited here rather than by each caller. There are four ways to
  get a key — the settings LiveView, `POST /api/auth/api-keys`, `POST
  /api/auth/token` and the per-conversation callback rotation — and only the
  first two used to leave a trail. `/api/auth/token` sits on `:api_public`, so
  the pipeline's audit plug never saw it: the one path that exchanges a
  password for a full-scope key was the only one that minted silently (#542).

  Options:

    * `:scopes` — defaults to `["full"]`
    * `:expires_at` — defaults to no expiry
    * `:actor` — who minted it, for the audit trail. Defaults to `"self"`;
      pass `FountainWeb.Audited.attribution/2` from a web surface, or a
      `"system:<worker>"` string from a background one.
    * `:request_ip` — passed through to the audit event.

  Returns `{:ok, {%ApiKey{}, raw_key_string}}` or `{:error, changeset}`.

  Suspend an account: the reversible abuse lever between comp and delete.
  Deletion is irreversible and destroys evidence; a zeroed sandbox quota stops
  new sandboxes but not logins or running conversations. This stops everything,
  reversibly.

  Sets `suspended_at`, bumps `session_version` (existing sessions die at the
  next request), then best-effort reaps every active sandbox — a failed sprite
  termination logs and moves on rather than failing the suspend; `SandboxReaper`
  sweeps stragglers. Login and API-key auth refuse while `suspended_at` is set.

  Billing is deliberately untouched: the Stripe subscription keeps running and
  webhooks keep syncing status (like comped, inverted — the status is accurate,
  the gate is elsewhere). A suspension is short-lived or becomes a deletion;
  pausing Stripe would add a resume path for an account we may be about to
  destroy.
