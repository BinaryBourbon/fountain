defmodule Fountain.OAuth do
  @moduledoc """
  Fountain as the OAuth 2.0 authorization server for its own first-party
  apps — the standalone team and conversations clients on another origin
  (#818) and the CLI's device login (#1305) — as an instance of
  `Managoat.OAuth` (ADR 0037, #1343).

  The problem it solves: those apps authenticate every API call with a
  bearer API key, and until now the key had to be pasted in. This turns a
  Fountain *session* (however it was opened — password or GitHub) into an
  API key for the app, with the user's consent, without the app ever seeing
  credentials.

  The grant is **authorization code + PKCE (S256), public clients only** —
  what a browser app can do safely — plus the device grant for a terminal
  that cannot hold a password. There is no client secret; the redirect URI
  allowlist and the PKCE verifier are what bind a code to the app that
  started the flow. The state machine, the two tables' schemas and the
  client registry's shape are the library's; what the library asks of the
  platform is `Fountain.OAuth.Host`: whether a user may hold a key, minting
  the key, and the audit trail.

  ## Clients

  Two registries. Application config holds the operator's — `config :fountain,
  Fountain.OAuth, clients: [%{id, name, redirect_uris}]`, which runtime.exs
  reads from `OAUTH_CLIENTS` as JSON — and the `oauth_clients` table holds
  the ones a tenant registers for itself (#1125). Config wins on a collision,
  so a row can never shadow a first-party client.

  **Development mode is the security boundary, not the redirect allowlist.**
  A row starts unpublished, and an unpublished client authorizes only its
  owner: every other account is rendered an error page, never redirected.
  That is what makes a self-chosen redirect URI safe — the only account such
  a client can capture belongs to the person who registered it — and it is
  why its owner may name any HTTPS redirect or an HTTP loopback one.
  `published` is an operator flip with no self-serve path, and a published
  client is an ordinary first-party client on config's terms.

  Redirect URIs match **exactly**, except that an unpublished loopback
  redirect matches on any port (RFC 8252 §7.3), because the port a local dev
  server lands on is not a fact anybody registered.

  `redirect_registered?/2` is the **only** redirect gate in the server.
  `grant_client/2` hands the library a client whose registered list is the
  requested URI, so `Managoat.OAuth.Clients.validate_request/2` always agrees
  and is no longer a second opinion. Loosening the check here loosens
  everything; there is nothing behind it.

  ## Tokens are API keys

  A successful exchange mints an ordinary API key (`Accounts.create_api_key/3`)
  named `oauth:<client_id>`, full scope, with an expiry — so it lists and
  revokes under Account → API keys, `TenantAPIAuth` needs no change, and the
  audit trail already knows the shape. No refresh tokens (yet): the app
  signs in again when the key expires. That is a Fountain decision, made in
  the host, not the library's.
