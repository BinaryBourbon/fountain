defmodule Fountain.SandboxProviders do
  @moduledoc """
  Which sandbox providers this deployment can name, and which it can use.

  `Managoat.Sandbox` (the library, decisions/0037) answers only "which module
  serves this provider atom", through its adapter map. Everything here is
  deployment policy layered on that, and it reads Fountain's configuration,
  which is why it lives in Fountain rather than in the library:

    * `known_providers/0` — the closed vocabulary the schemas validate
      against (`Agents.Agent`, `Conversations.Sandbox`). Knowing a provider
      is not the same as having it configured.
    * `default_provider/0` — `SANDBOX_PROVIDER`, validated at boot in
      `config/runtime.exs`.
    * `enabled?/1` / `enabled_providers/0` — whether a provider is usable on
      this instance: its adapter is registered **and** its credential is
      configured (for `:runner`, which has none, that it has not been
      switched off). Enabledness is runtime state — the schema validates
      against `known_providers/0`, selection validates against this.
