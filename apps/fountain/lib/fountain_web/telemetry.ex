  Metrics exported to Prometheus.

  Deliberately a separate list from `metrics/0`. That one is built for
  LiveDashboard and is all `summary/2`, which the Prometheus core reporter does
  not implement — wiring it up directly raises at boot. Prometheus wants
  `distribution` (histogram), `counter`, `sum` and `last_value`.

  Bucket boundaries are in milliseconds and chosen around what matters here:
  sub-100ms is a healthy page render, and the tail past 1s is what a user
