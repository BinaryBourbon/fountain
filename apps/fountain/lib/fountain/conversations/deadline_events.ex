defmodule Fountain.Conversations.DeadlineEvents do
  @moduledoc """
  Records deadline outcomes in the same transaction as the failed turn.

  Webhook jobs and a retryable local notification share that transaction. The
  persisted log id is the deduplication identity for both streams and callbacks.
  Notifications may repeat; the terminal log event is inserted only once under
  the execution journal lock. No actor or provider call participates.

  **The atomicity here is deliberate, and it is the exception to the usual
  rule.** Elsewhere a recording is best-effort precisely so that a failed insert
  cannot take its mutation down (ADR 0013). Here it is the opposite: a turn that
  is durably failed while nothing was ever told is the bug this module exists to
  prevent, so `Conversations.log!/1`, `Webhooks.dispatch_stage!/1` and
  `Oban.insert!/1` all raise inside the caller's transaction and *should* roll
  the turn write back. The caller retries; the alternative is a silent
  disagreement between the journal and every reader of it.

  `_unsafe_record!/2` is the one thing that does not raise: it returns `nil`
  when the ownership recheck fails, because a conversation that changed hands is
  not this deadline's to publish on. That path is logged rather than silent.
