defmodule FountainWeb.Plugs.Cors do
  @moduledoc """
  CORS for `/api/*`, for a browser client on another origin — the standalone
  team app (#810) is the first.

  The operator's `API_CORS_ORIGINS` list is checked first. A registered OAuth
  client's redirect origin is checked second, so registering an app is enough
  to call the API from it without another operator setting (#1125).

  With neither source, the API stays same-origin plus non-browser clients.
  No cookies are ever allowed across origins
  (`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is never sent), so a session cannot be
  ridden from an allowed origin — only an explicitly presented API key works,
  which is the point.

  A preflight (`OPTIONS` with `Access-Control-Request-Method`) from an allowed
  origin is answered here with 204 and never reaches the router, which would
  otherwise 404 it before any header could be set.
