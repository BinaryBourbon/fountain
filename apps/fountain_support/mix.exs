  @moduledoc """
  The problem-report extension (ADR 0043, #1528).

  The second first-party Fountain extension, and the one that exists to prove
  the seam rather than to widen it: it uses three of the nine callbacks
  (`api_mounts/0`, `migrations/0`, `openapi_paths/0`) and adds none.

  An OTP application that depends on `:fountain`, is compiled into the bundled
  release, and is switched on by naming `FountainSupport.Extension` in
  `config :fountain, :extensions`.

  AGPL-3.0-or-later, like `apps/fountain` and `apps/fountain_buzz` and unlike a
  `managoat_*` component library (ADR 0037): databaseful, Fountain-specific
  product code that depends on the server. Not published to hex.
