# Configure email

This guide shows you how to choose a mail setting. Fountain makes you decide.
It is not an optional extra.

Fountain refuses to start in production without one. A verification email that
Fountain throws away leaves signup at a dead end, with no error to see.

## Choose one of three

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend delivers the mail. |
| `SMTP_HOST` (with `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`) | Any SMTP server. The port defaults to 587 with STARTTLS. Omit the username for a relay that wants no authentication. |
| `EMAIL_DELIVERY=none` | No email. An account self-verifies at registration (ADR 0011). |

`EMAIL_FROM` sets the sender in the first two modes.

## What each choice costs you

A password reset also needs mail that works. With `EMAIL_DELIVERY=none`, the
one route back into a locked-out account is the database.

That is the trade the mode's boot notice warns you about. It is usually the
right trade for a one-operator instance, where you can run a release task.

The [mail integration guide](../../integrations/mail.md) covers the provider
side. It has domain verification, and what each mode means for signup.

## Verify it worked

Register a throwaway account and watch for the verification mail. If no mail
arrives, verify the account by hand. Treat that as a mail setup that failed,
and not as a fix.

```bash
docker compose exec app bin/fountain_server eval \
  'Fountain.Release.verify_email("them@example.com")'
```

## If it did not work

The provider accepts mail from a domain that nobody verified. SPF, DKIM and
DMARC then fail downstream, and the receiver rejects the message or files it
as spam. Read
