defmodule FountainWeb.TurnImageController do
  @moduledoc """
  Images attached to a turn, for the browser session
  (`GET /conversations/:conversation_id/turns/:turn_id/images/:position`) and
  for bearer tokens (`/api/conversations/...`, #578).

  Both routes used to be one `:show` action, which caused two problems. The
  bearer route sat inside the `:accepts_json` pipeline, so
  `plug :accepts, ["json"]` refused `Accept: image/png` with 406 *before* the
  action ran — an endpoint returning PNG bytes worked only if the caller did
  not ask for an image. And a single action behind two routes cannot be given
  an OpenAPI operation without also emitting the session-authenticated browser
  route into the spec as a bearer endpoint, so turn images were in no spec at
  all while `Turn.image_count` advertised them.

  Split the way #528 split `AgentAvatarController`: `:show` for the browser,
  `:api_show` for bearer tokens, one private serve path so the guards cannot
  drift between them.
