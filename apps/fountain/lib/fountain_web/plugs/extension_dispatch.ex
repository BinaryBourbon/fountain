defmodule FountainWeb.Plugs.ExtensionDispatch do
  @moduledoc """
  Serves `/api/<prefix>/...` for an installed extension (ADR 0043, #1505).

  Mounted as the **last** route in the router, forwarded at `/api` inside
  `pipe_through [:accepts_json, :api]`. Two properties fall out of that
  placement, and both are the point:

    * **Core routes win.** Phoenix matches routes in declaration order, so this
      plug only ever sees a request that matched no core route. An extension
      cannot shadow `/api/agents` by mounting there — and
      `Fountain.Extensions.validate!/0` refuses an overlapping mount at boot
      anyway, so the collision is a failed deploy rather than a route quietly
      doing nothing.
    * **Authentication is not optional.** The `:api` pipeline — the rate limit,
      `TenantAPIAuth`, the request audit — has already run by the time this
      plug is called, on the host's terms. There is no prefix an extension can
      choose that reaches its plug without `conn.assigns.current_user` being
      set by the host, because there is no second door.

  The extension's plug is called with the matched mount moved from `path_info`
  to `script_name`, the way `Phoenix.Router.forward/4` does it, so the extension
  writes its routes relative to its own mount and its path helpers still
  generate the full path.

  The **longest** declared mount wins, which is what lets one extension hold
  both `/api/buzz` and `/api/mcp/buzz` with a different plug behind each.

  ## What is deliberately not caught

  A raise inside an extension's plug propagates, exactly as it would from a
  core controller: 500, and the error reporter sees it. Only the MCP
  contribution is isolated (`Fountain.Extensions.conversation_mcp_servers/2`),
  because there a failure would cost an unrelated conversation its turn. A
  swallowed 500 on an API request would just be a lie to the client.
