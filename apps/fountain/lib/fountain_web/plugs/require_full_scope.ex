defmodule FountainWeb.Plugs.RequireFullScope do
  @moduledoc """
  Restricts account-level writes to `full`-scoped API keys.

  Every conversation hands its sprite a tenant API key so the agent can stream,
  prompt, and spawn sub-agents. Those tokens are `sprite`-scoped and are
  deliberately weaker than the owner's own key: code running in a sandbox is
  untrusted by design, so it must not be able to change the account out from
  under the person who owns it — replace the tenant's inference credentials,
  rotate the password, delete the account.

  `FountainWeb.Plugs.RequireKeyManagement` is the original, API-key-specific
  instance of this rule and now delegates here so there is one implementation
  of "is this credential allowed to act on the account itself".

  Pass `:error` to describe the refused capability; the response always carries
  `reason: "insufficient_scope"` and `required_scope: "full"` so callers can
  branch on shape rather than prose.

  Session-authenticated browser routes never reach this plug; it guards the
  bearer-token API pipeline only.
