  The scratch-path helper, and the guardrail that keeps the defect it fixes
  from coming back (#1423).

  The bug this replaces was not a wrong assertion anywhere. It was a path built
  from `System.unique_integer/1` alone, which is unique per BEAM node while
  `$TMPDIR` is shared by the whole host — so two concurrent `mix test` runs
  built the same path and deleted each other's files. It cost a session two
  false diagnoses, because the failure lands on whichever test was running and
  reads as a regression in that branch.

  CI cannot catch it: the six partitions each get their own machine. The
  guardrail below is what catches it instead, at review time, by refusing the
  spelling rather than the symptom.
