  The https redirect must not apply to the health probes.

  kubelet hits them directly on the pod IP, over plain http and with no
  X-Forwarded-Proto, because there is no proxy on that path. Plug.SSL saw http
  and answered 301; the probe scored a redirect as a failure; the pod never
  became ready; the deployment stalled on its progress deadline with an app that
  was running perfectly. Nothing in the logs said "broken" — the only clue was
