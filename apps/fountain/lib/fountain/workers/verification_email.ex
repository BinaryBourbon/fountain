defmodule Fountain.Workers.VerificationEmail do
  @moduledoc """
  Sends the email-verification link as a durable job (#445).

  Registration used to send this with a bare `Task.async` and no `await`. The
  task was *linked* to the request process, so finishing the HTTP response
  could kill an in-flight send, and a delivery error had no retry and no log —
  the failure mode every request-path send has been extracted for since.
  This one was worse: with no resend route, a
  dropped verification email left the account permanently unusable until the
  `UnverifiedAccountPruner` deleted it.

  The token is signed in `perform/1`, not at enqueue time. Job args are stored
  in `oban_jobs`, so a token minted at enqueue would sit in the database in
  plaintext, and by the time a retried job finally delivered it could be well
  into its 24 h TTL. Each attempt sends a fresh, full-TTL link instead.
