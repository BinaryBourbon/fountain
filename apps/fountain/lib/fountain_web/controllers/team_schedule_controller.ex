defmodule FountainWeb.TeamScheduleController do
  @moduledoc """
  Team schedules over the API (#825): the routines `/team` offers — a cron
  that runs a teammate with a prompt, in its thread or on a one-off computer
  — for a client that is not this web app.

  Every action is a thin wrapper over `Fountain.Team.Schedules`, under the
  same tenant scoping and audit attribution as the rest of `/api/team`. The
  `:agent_id` in the path is part of the identity: a schedule reached under
  another agent's path is a 404, the same as one that is not the caller's.
