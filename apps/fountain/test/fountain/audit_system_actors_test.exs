  Background paths that mutate tenant data leave a trail too (#551).

  The precedent this follows is `UnverifiedAccountPruner`, which deletes
  through `Accounts.Deletion` with `actor: "system:unverified_pruner"` and gets
  audited for free. Everything here was the opposite: real changes to a
  tenant's data, attributable to nothing but a line in the server log.

  The sharpest case is the retention pruner, which deletes `audit_events`
  itself — so before this the trail could shrink with no record of when or by
  how much.
