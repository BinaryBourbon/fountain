defmodule Fountain.Manifest do
  @moduledoc """
  Bulk apply for compiled IaC manifests (`fountain apply`).

  Takes the full list of resources the CLI compiled from a `fountain.yml`
  and reconciles them against the tenant's records in one pass, in a fixed
  order: environments, vaults, agents, teammates, schedules, webhooks. The
  order is what lets a document reference another by name regardless of
  where it sits in the file. An Agent's `environment`, a Teammate's `agent`,
  `environment` and `vault`, and a Schedule's `teammate` all resolve against
  the documents applied earlier in this manifest first, then against the
  tenant's existing records.

  Each kind has its own upsert key:

  | Kind | Key | Reconciled through |
  |---|---|---|
  | `Environment` | `name` | `Fountain.Environments` |
  | `Vault` | `name` | `Fountain.Vaults` |
  | `Agent` | `name` | `Fountain.Agents` |
  | `Teammate` | `name`, which names the agent's membership | `Fountain.Team` |
  | `Schedule` | `name`, under its `teammate` | `Fountain.Team.Schedules` |
  | `Webhook` | `spec.url` | `Fountain.Webhooks` |

  A teammate is one agent's membership of the team, so the document's `name`
  is what the teammate is called and the resolved `agent` is what it
  reconciles against. Re-applying a Teammate with a different `name` renames
  it rather than adding a second membership for the same agent, and two
  documents naming one agent are refused past the first: they describe one
  record, so without the refusal each pass would rename the other's
  conversation and no apply would ever be `unchanged`.

  A Teammate document is also the only one read as a whole declaration. On
  the other five an absent `spec` key leaves that column alone; on a Teammate
  an absent `environment` or `vault` clears the binding, back to the agent's
  own environment and no vault. Moving either id moves the teammate's
  computer, which `Fountain.Team.update_teammate/4` retires and refuses
  mid-turn (#1084).

  Application is best-effort per resource: a document that fails validation,
  that a context refuses, or that raises is reported in its own result entry
  and does not stop the rest of the manifest.

  Apply is additive. A document removed from the manifest leaves its record
  in place; there is no prune. A `Webhook` whose `spec.url` changes is a new
  endpoint for that reason, and the one the old URL named keeps delivering.

  Apply `resources` (maps with `"kind"`, `"name"`, and `"spec"`) for `user_id`.

  Returns `{:ok, results}` with one result map per resource in apply order
  (the six kinds in the order above, then any malformed entries). Each result
  holds `:kind`, `:name`, an `:action` of `:created` / `:updated` /
  `:unchanged` / `:error`, changeset-style `:errors` when the action is
  `:error`, a `:secrets` list with the per-key upsert outcome, the
  reconciled record's `:id` (nil for errors), and `:secret`, which carries a
  webhook endpoint's signing secret on the apply that created it and is nil
  everywhere else.

  `:unchanged` means the record already matched the document, so nothing was
  written to it. Inline `spec.secrets` are re-encrypted on every apply and
  keep reporting `:upserted` in `:secrets`, whatever the row's own verdict
  says: the stored ciphertext cannot be compared with the plaintext given.
