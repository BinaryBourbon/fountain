defmodule FountainWeb.Live.Hooks do
  @moduledoc """
  LiveView `on_mount` hooks for multi-tenant authentication and billing.

  ## Usage in router live_session

      live_session :authenticated,
        on_mount: [{FountainWeb.Live.Hooks, :require_authenticated_user}] do
        live "/dashboard", DashboardLive, :index
      end

  ## Hooks

  - `:require_authenticated_user` — halts and redirects to login if no
    current_user is set, or to `/auth/verify-pending` if the user's email is
    unverified.
  - `:require_pending_verification` — the inverse gate, for the waiting page
    itself: requires a session but tolerates an unverified one, and bounces
    already-verified users to where they belong so the page can't be camped on.
  - `:require_admin` — halts if current_user is absent or not an admin.
    Unauthenticated users are redirected to login (HTTP redirect). Authenticated
    non-admin users are redirected to /dashboard (live redirect).

  There is no billing hook: the gate that protects spend is
  `Fountain.Billing.check_spend/1` in the context (ADR 0031), so the console
  stays readable for an account with no credit.
