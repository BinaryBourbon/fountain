defmodule FountainWeb.ApiSpec.Compose do
  @moduledoc """
  Merges installed extensions' OpenAPI paths and components into the core spec
  (ADR 0043, #1506).

  ## Why this is not just `Map.merge/2`

  A spec is two namespaces, and both merge badly by default:

    * **Paths.** Two operations at the same path: last writer wins, silently.
    * **Components.** `OpenApiSpex.resolve_schema_modules/1` keys
      `components.schemas` by each schema's `title`, so two *different* modules
      sharing a title collapse into one and every `$ref` to either resolves to
      whichever landed last. An extension defining a schema titled `Agent`
      would rewrite the core's `Agent` in the published spec, and the four SDKs
      are generated from that spec (#1411).

  Both raise here instead. The failure surfaces when the spec is built — which
  is at boot, in `mix openapi.spec.json`, and in the suite — rather than as a
  wrong client three releases later.

  ## The distribution is what the spec describes

  `spec/0` composes from `Fountain.Extensions.installed/0` at call time, so a
  core-only distribution's spec has no extension paths in it, and the bundled
  one's has exactly the operations it serves. There is no build flag and no
  second artifact: the published spec **is** the bundled spec, which is the
  contract the SDKs generate from and what ADR 0043 decision 6 promises not to
  change silently.
