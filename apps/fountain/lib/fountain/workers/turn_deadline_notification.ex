defmodule Fountain.Workers.TurnDeadlineNotification do
  @moduledoc """
  Delivers a persisted deadline stage independently of the conversation actor.

  Webhook jobs were already committed with the event. This job only notifies
  local subscribers and telemetry; retries reuse the same event id. Deleted
  transcripts or changed ownership suppress notification without touching the
  remote execution journal.

  # Its own queue. Not `:webhooks`, which delivers to customers and would see a
  # deadline storm compete with real deliveries — the webhook job for this event
  # was already committed beside it (see `DeadlineEvents`), so nothing here is
  # customer-facing. And not `:maintenance`, which is concurrency 1 behind eight
  # sweeps: a notification whose whole job is to be prompt must not queue behind
  # the retention pruner.
  #
  # Three attempts, not twenty. The event is already durable, so a retry only
  # re-pushes it to live SSE subscribers; a subscriber that missed the first
  # three is not helped by the twentieth, and reads the outcome from the
  # transcript when it reconnects.
