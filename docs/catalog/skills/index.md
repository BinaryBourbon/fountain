# Skills

A skill is a `SKILL.md` that Fountain writes into the sandbox. The runtime
reads it to learn a capability. You declare skills on an
[Agent](../../concepts/agent.md).

## Bundled in each sandbox

Fountain writes these two into **each** sandbox, whatever an agent declares.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| [fountain](fountain.md) | Gives the agent Fountain's own API, so it can start sub-conversations and stream them. |
| [create-team](create-team.md) | A five-question flow that builds the user's team. An answer of `/create-team` runs it. |

## How to declare your own

There are two forms, and they behave differently.

**Inline.** Fountain writes the whole file to
`<skills_root>/<name>/SKILL.md`.

```yaml
skills:
  - name: house-style
    content: |
      ---
      name: house-style
      description: Our commit message and PR conventions.
      ---
      # House style
      ...
```

**From GitHub.** The [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) CLI installs it on the
sandbox.

```yaml
skills:
  - source: BinaryBourbon/fountain-api-skill
    ref: v1.2.0        # optional: a tag, branch or sha
    name: fountain-api # optional: rename on install
```

With no `ref`, Fountain resolves the repository's default branch **at spawn
time**. Two conversations from the same agent, a week apart, can install
different code. Pin a `ref` on whatever you depend on.

## Two things about how they land

**Skills mount before the network policy locks the sandbox down.** A GitHub
install needs npm and github.com, so it happens first. A `limited` environment
that allowlists neither still gets its skills, and this order is the reason.

**A GitHub install runs before an inline write.** The install is an exec that
blocks, and it also serves as the readiness gate that the file-write path
needs.

## The path depends on the runtime

Each runtime declares its own skills root and its own skills.sh agent name. So
one declaration lands in a different place for each `runtime`. Read
[Runtimes](../runtimes/index.md) for the table.

## Not here yet

There is no catalog of third-party skills. Any GitHub repo that ships a
`SKILL.md` works, and Fountain curates no list.
