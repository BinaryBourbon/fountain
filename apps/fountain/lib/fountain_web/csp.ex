  Widens the `content-security-policy` header the `:browser` pipeline sets
  with origins that are only known at runtime.

  `FountainWeb.Router`'s `@csp` is a compile-time attribute, so anything read
  from the environment in `config/runtime.exs` cannot appear in it: a release
  would carry whatever the *build* saw, which is nothing. Two plugs widen it
  per response instead — `FountainWeb.Plugs.WebAnalytics` for the PostHog
  origins on the public pages, `FountainWeb.Plugs.BrandAssets` for the origin
  a brand bundle is served from — and both go through here so the header has
  one rewriter.

  @doc """
  Appends `origins` to each of the named `directives` of the response's
  policy. A response with no policy is returned untouched: adding one here
  would be inventing a second source of truth for a header the `:browser`
  pipeline owns.
