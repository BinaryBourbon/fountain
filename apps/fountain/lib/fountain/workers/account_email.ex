defmodule Fountain.Workers.AccountEmail do
  @moduledoc """
  Account-state notifications (#450): suspended, unsuspended, deleted.

  Separate from `Workers.LifecycleEmail` because these are not billing-status
  transitions and its status guards don't fit — a suspension can happen to an
  account in any billing state, and a deletion has no user row left to guard
  on at all.

  State-dependent kinds re-check at send time: a suspension lifted before the
  queue drained must not then be announced. The `"deleted"` kind carries the
  address itself (captured before the row delete) and sends unconditionally —
  there is nothing left to check against. Verification is enforced where the
  user row still exists: the worker skips unverified accounts, and the
  deletion path only enqueues for verified ones, so no kind ever confirms an
  unverified address exists.
