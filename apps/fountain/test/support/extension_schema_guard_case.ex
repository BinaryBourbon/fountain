defmodule FountainWeb.ExtensionSchemaGuardCase do
  @moduledoc """
  The schema guard's own coverage check, for one extension (ADR 0043, #1536).

  `FountainWeb.SchemaGuard` validates every response the suite renders against
  the schema its operation declares — and for the first two extensions it
  validated none of them, silently, for as long as they existed. The core
  router ends `/api` with `forward "/", ExtensionDispatch`, and a forward is
  opaque to `Phoenix.Router.route_info/4`: it reports the forward's own route,
  `/api`, which matches no documented path, so every extension response was
  skipped as `:undocumented`.

  Nothing failed, because a guard that checks nothing looks exactly like a
  guard that finds nothing. That is the failure this file exists to make
  impossible a second time: it asserts the guard can *resolve* every operation
  the extension documents, which is the step that was missing. It says nothing
  about whether those responses are correct — the guard itself does that, on
  every request the extension's own tests make.

  Use it from the extension's suite, naming the extension module:

      defmodule FountainBuzz.SchemaGuardTest do
        use FountainWeb.ExtensionSchemaGuardCase, extension: FountainBuzz.Extension
      end

  It lives in core's `test/support` rather than in each extension because both
  extensions need the identical checks and neither may depend on the other. It
  names no extension: the module under test arrives as an option, and
  everything else is read from `Fountain.Extensions`, which is the host's own
  registry.
