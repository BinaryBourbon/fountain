defmodule FountainWeb.Plugs.Audit do
  @moduledoc """
  Records state-changing API requests to the audit log on the way out.

  Captures:
    * `action`: HTTP verb + last path segment after `/api/` (e.g.
      `POST conversations`, `DELETE environments/:id/secrets/:id`).
    * `resource_type`, `resource_id`: derived from the matched route's
      action + params.
    * `actor`: derived from the credential — `"sprite"` for a per-conversation
      callback token, `"api"` otherwise. Previously hardcoded to `"api"`, which
      made a human, a CI job and an agent running inside a sandbox
      indistinguishable in the trail.
    * `request_ip`: from `conn.remote_ip`.
    * `metadata`: response status code.

  Read methods (GET) are not audited — they're noisy and rarely
  interesting. Failures (4xx/5xx) are still recorded so we can see
  rejected attempts.

  ## Why this stays, now that contexts audit themselves

  #540 moved semantic auditing into the context functions, which means an API
  mutation now writes two rows: `agent.updated` from `Agents.update_agent/3`,
  and `PUT /api/agents/:id` + status from here. That looked like something to
  clean up, and the decision was to keep both — they answer different
  questions:

    * the context event says **what changed** — a semantic action, the fields
      that moved, the resource;
    * this plug says **what was attempted** — verb, path, and the status code,
      including for requests that were refused. A 403 on a route whose context
      never ran leaves no semantic event at all, and a run of them is the
      signal you actually want.

  Scoping this down to "only routes whose context does not audit yet" was the
  alternative, and it was rejected: that list would be a second place to
  remember, one forgotten entry away from a silently unaudited route — the
  exact failure mode #540 existed to remove.

  Recorded as a decision in ADR 0013 §4 — two rows per API mutation is
  intended, and deduplicating them in the UI would lose the refused requests.
