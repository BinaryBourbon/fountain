  @moduledoc """
  Producer side of the turn metrics — duration (#536) and time to first
  token (#535).

  `FountainWeb.Telemetry` declares histograms over
  `[:fountain, :turn, :completed]` and `[:fountain, :turn, :first_output]`;
  a metric subscribed to an event nobody emits scrapes empty forever and
  looks exactly like a healthy quiet system (#310). These pin that
  ConversationServer actually fires them, on every path that ends a turn and
  on the first byte out of the sandbox, with the tags the histograms read.
