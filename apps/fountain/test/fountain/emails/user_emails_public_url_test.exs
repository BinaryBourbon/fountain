# async: false — these tests write the global `:public_url`, and
# `FountainWeb.OpenGraph.url/1` reads it on every page render in the suite.
#
# They used to sit in `user_emails_test.exs`, which is `async: true`. While
# one of them held `:public_url` at `fountain.example.com`, a controller test
# rendering a page beside it saw that host in its `og:url` and failed an
# assertion about `http://localhost:4000`. Same shape as the fleet ceiling in
# `quotas_fleet_ceiling_test.exs`: an async module writing global config that
# production code reads on a hot path.
