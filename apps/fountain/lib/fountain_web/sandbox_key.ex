defmodule FountainWeb.SandboxKey do
  @moduledoc """
  Which sandbox credential a request was made with, for the contexts whose
  rules depend on it.

  A conversation hands its sandbox a `sprite`-scoped API key. That key
  authenticates as the *account*, so every tenant-scoped check passes for
  every conversation the account owns — which is exactly the gap ADR 0045
  describes. A context that must tell "this sandbox's own conversation" from
  "another conversation of the same tenant" needs the key's id, and
  `FountainWeb.Audited.attribution/2` deliberately carries only the actor.

  One derivation, in one place, so a new door cannot get it subtly wrong:
  `opts/1` returns the keyword pair to append beside `attribution/1`, and is
  `[]` for anything that is not a sandbox token (a session, the owner's own
  full-scope key, a background caller), which every rule reads as "no sandbox
  restriction applies".
