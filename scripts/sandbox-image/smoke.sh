# Asserts the base-image shape Fountain's provisioning pipeline assumes.
#
# This runs INSIDE a sandbox (or inside the image under `docker run`), never on
# the CI runner. Every caller ships it the same way — base64 on one command
# line — so the E2B template, the Daytona snapshot and a local `docker build`
# are held to the identical contract.
#
# Every check stands for a provisioning step that fails in a way that is hard
# to read from the outside. The npm one is the #691 trap: a global install as
# `sprite` against the root-owned default prefix exits 243 with no output, and
# the conversation only reports that the runtime is missing. It is checked by
# doing the install, not by reading the setting, because the setting was right
# in the image that failed.
#
# SMOKE_EXPECT_USER asserts which user the provider selected in-guest, and is
# set only where Fountain pins that: E2B, where envd picks the user from Basic
# auth and E2B_USER must match what the template creates. Daytona picks its own
# and the value is reported rather than asserted.
#
# The exit code and the trailing marker both carry the verdict: a provider exec
# API that swallows the exit code still cannot fake the marker.
