# Before a tool runs

An agent works in a sandbox. Sooner or later it wants to run a command, edit a
file, or fetch a URL. A **permission policy** says what happens at that moment.

The runtime asks Fountain first. Fountain answers from the policy. The tool
then runs, or it does not.

## The three answers

| Verdict | What Fountain does |
|---|---|
| `auto_allow` | It permits the tool. This is the default, and it is what every agent did before the policy existed. |
| `ask` | It holds the request, and a human answers it. Nobody answers in 5 minutes, and Fountain refuses. |
| `auto_deny` | It refuses the tool. It chooses a refusal that the runtime offered, and invents none. |

A refusal does not stop the turn. The agent reads that it has no permission,
and it continues.

## Where a policy lives

An agent holds one. Each conversation on that agent runs under it.

A launch can send its own policy, on `POST /api/conversations`, on ACP
`session/new`, or with `fountain acp --permission`. Fountain merges the two,
and keeps the stricter verdict for each key.

**A launch can only narrow.** A launch policy that permits more than the agent
does gets a 422 that names the key. Fountain refuses it, and does not clamp it
quietly. Because of that rule, there is no allowlist beside this field. A
launch cannot reach a permission that the agent does not hold.

## Keys

A policy is a map. Each key names what the tool call is, and each value is a
verdict. The key `default` covers everything else.

```json
{ "default": "auto_allow", "execute": "ask" }
```

Fountain reads the keys in this order.

1. The **title** on the tool card, which is the agent's own words.
2. The **kind**, which is ACP's own short list. It is one of `read`, `edit`,
   `delete`, `move`, `search`, `execute`, `think`, `fetch`, `switch_mode` and
   `other`.
3. The key `default`.

**Prefer a kind.** The claude and gemini runtimes put the command itself in the
title, and codex sends no title. A title key therefore matches one command, and
nothing else. A kind means the same thing on each turn, and on each runtime.

## When a human answers

With `ask`, the agent stops and waits. Fountain puts the request on the
conversation stream, as a `permission_request` block. It carries the tool, a
summary, and the runtime's own options.

Anyone with the conversation can answer it. The team app and the conversations
app show a card. An editor over `fountain acp` shows its own approval prompt.
Your own code can answer with
`POST /api/conversations/{id}/requests/{request_id}`.

Some rules keep that safe.

- **The first answer wins.** The other clients see a request that no longer
  waits. No client is a fallback for another.
- **Nobody is also an answer.** After 5 minutes, Fountain refuses the tool. The
  timeout sits below the idle bound, so a request that waits costs a turn and
  not the sandbox.
- **An option must come from the runtime.** Fountain refuses an option id that
  the runtime did not offer.
- **The agent cannot answer itself.** The sandbox holds an API token, and
  Fountain refuses that loop by name.

## What each runtime can do

| Runtime | Asks before a tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| claude | Yes | Measured on claude-agent-acp 0.66. Safe commands that its own sandbox runs never reach Fountain. |
| codex | Yes | Measured on codex-acp 1.1.14. |
| opencode | **No** | It decides this in its own server, and sends nothing. Fountain refuses a policy stricter than `auto_allow` on this runtime, with 422 `permission_policy_unenforceable` ([#959](https://github.com/BinaryBourbon/fountain/issues/959)). |
| gemini | Yes | Measured on gemini 0.53 with `gemini-2.5-flash`. Google removed that model for new API keys after this measurement. Its option ids are its own (`proceed_once`, `cancel`), so answer with an id from the request, never a name you know from another runtime. |

## An "always" answer does not always hold

Each runtime that asks offers an option that means "do not ask me again".
Fountain sends the option id, and it keeps no record of the answer. The runtime
decides how long its own grant lasts, and the three runtimes disagree.

| Runtime | How long an "always" answer lasts |
|---|---|
| claude | It writes a rule to a file in the sandbox. The rule holds for later turns. |
| codex | `Allow for Session` lasts the whole sandbox wake (#817). The option that amends the command policy goes to a file, and it holds. |
| opencode | This runtime never asks, so it grants nothing. |

Every grant lives inside the sandbox. A new sandbox starts with none of them.

Two limits are open work.

- codex keeps a session grant across turns now. The protocol connection lives
  for the sandbox wake, not one turn, so the grant in the runtime process
  survives (#817). A grant is still lost when the sandbox parks or the
  conversation ends. See
  [#996](https://github.com/BinaryBourbon/fountain/issues/996).
- claude asks again for a command that writes outside the directory where it
  runs.
  The rule that `Always Allow` writes cannot answer the check that stopped the
  command, so the prompt repeats. This is a defect in the runtime, and the
  report is
  [anthropics/claude-code#88919](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/88919).

## What the audit trail keeps

Fountain records a refusal, with the tool and the verdict. It records no
values, and no inputs.

It records no permits. One turn makes many tool calls, and a row for each would
make the trail a copy of the transcript.

## How to set one

- **The console.** Open the agent, and use *Before the agent runs a tool*.
- **The API.** `PATCH /api/agents/{id}` with `permission_policy`.
- **An editor.** `fountain acp --permission ask`, or
  `fountain acp --permission execute=ask`.
