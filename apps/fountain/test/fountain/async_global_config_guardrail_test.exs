defmodule Fountain.AsyncGlobalConfigGuardrailTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  @moduledoc """
  An `async: true` test module must not write `Application.put_env(:fountain, ...)`.

  Application env is global. ExUnit runs async modules concurrently, so a
  module that writes config changes it for every test running beside it, for
  as long as the write is held. When production code reads that key on a hot
  path, the result is a failure in a *different* file, on some seeds only, and
  usually not on the machine of whoever has to explain it.

  Two of these were live in the suite before this guardrail:

    * `quotas_test.exs` held `:sandboxes` `fleet_ceiling` at 2, and
      `conversations_start_test.exs` lost its tenant-cap assertions to
      `{:error, :fleet_full}`.
    * `user_emails_test.exs` held `:public_url` at `fountain.example.com`, and
      every `og:url` assertion in the suite failed while it did.

  Both now live in sibling `async: false` modules. ExUnit runs every async
  module first and the sync ones one at a time afterwards, so a sync module
  cannot overlap an async one — which is the whole fix, and the reason the
  answer here is "move it", not "add a lock".

  The allowlist is not a blessing. Each entry writes a key no concurrent test
  has been shown to read; none has been proven safe. Moving one into an
  `async: false` module is always correct, and is what to do the moment one of
  them is suspected in a flake. The list only shrinks.

  # were only caught because a reader happened to assert on the key. The keys
  # to fear are the ones production reads on a hot path — `:public_url` on
  # every render, `:sandboxes` on every reservation, `:credits_enabled` on
  # every gate. `:credits_enabled` is on this list three times; a seed sweep
  # did not reproduce a failure from it, so it stays here rather than being
  # moved on a hunch. It is the first place to look when a `:fleet_full` or a
  # balance assertion fails somewhere unrelated.
