# LLM integration

Fountain exists for an AI coding tool to consume. Each instance serves
discovery endpoints that a machine can read, so an agentic IDE learns the full
API from one fetch.

The examples below run against your own instance. Point `FOUNTAIN_URL` at it.

```bash
FOUNTAIN_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## A drop-in skill for Claude Code

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/fountain
curl -fsSL $FOUNTAIN_URL/skill > ~/.claude/skills/fountain/SKILL.md
```

After that, tell Claude to start a researcher agent on Fountain and to audit
the auth module. It works with no more setup.

## Discovery endpoints

| Endpoint | Content | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `/llms.txt` | A short API summary, about 500 tokens. | A model with little context to spare. |
| `/llms-full.txt` | The full API reference. | An agent that calls many tools. |
| `/skill` | The skill file for Claude Code and Cursor. | IDE skills. |

```bash
curl $FOUNTAIN_URL/llms.txt
curl $FOUNTAIN_URL/llms-full.txt
```

## There is no first-party MCP server

**Nobody built one.** An MCP server that exposes the four primitives as tools
is an idea that Fountain discussed and did not build. No package exists to
install, and no config block works. Use the `/skill` file above. It gives an
agentic IDE the full API surface in one fetch.

## How to use the API from an agent

1. Load the skill from `/skill` when the session starts.
2. Authenticate with a Fountain API key from the agent's environment.
3. Start sub-agents with the CLI or the REST API.

Here is an example prompt.

```
Please:
1. Create a Fountain conversation using the "security-auditor" agent
2. Set the prompt to: "Audit apps/fountain/lib/fountain_web/controllers/ for OWASP Top 10 issues"
3. Stream the output and report findings
```
