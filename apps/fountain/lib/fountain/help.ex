defmodule Fountain.Help do
  @moduledoc """
  The canonical list of in-app help topics.

  There used to be two hand-maintained copies — one in `HelpLive.Show`, one in
  `LlmsController` — with a comment on the second saying "keep them in sync".
  They were not in sync: the LiveView was missing `secrets-managers` and the
  controller was missing `skills`, so `/llms.txt` advertised a URL that flashed
  "No such help topic" and redirected, while the in-app nav hid a page that
  `/llms-full.txt` served in full.

  One list, and a test that checks it against `priv/help/` in both directions,
  so a new topic file with no entry (or an entry with no file) fails rather than
  drifting.
