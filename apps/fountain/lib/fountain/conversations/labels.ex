defmodule Fountain.Conversations.Labels do
  @moduledoc """
  The rule for a conversation's labels (#1637), in one place.

  A label is a free-form `key => value` pair of strings on the conversation
  row. A person titles and searches their own threads; a program running as a
  teammate wants to slice its runs by facts it knew when the turn ended —
  `env=prod`, `drift=true`, `gated=apply`. Those facts are not text worth
  searching, so they are not in the full-text index and never will be.

  Every door that writes labels goes through `changeset/1` here, so the
  limits cannot drift between the create request, the labels route, the team
  message and the ACP extension notification:

    * at most 32 entries;
    * a key is a non-empty string of at most 64 bytes;
    * a value is a string of at most 256 bytes;
    * neither may contain a NUL byte, which Postgres refuses inside `jsonb`.

  A refusal names the offending key, because a caller sending thirty-two of
  them cannot otherwise tell which one Fountain disliked. On a merge the key
  named is one the caller actually sent — see `check_merge/2`.

  ## Merge, and how a key is removed

  Writes merge (`merge/2`): a key that is not mentioned is left alone. A key
  whose value is `null` is removed. That is what lets a run add one label
  without reading the others first, and what makes a channel resume keep the
  labels the binding already carried.

  ## The list filter

  `GET /api/conversations?label=env:prod&label=drift:true` is repeatable and
  AND-combined. Each value splits on its **first** colon only, so
  `label=path:a:b` filters `path` for `a:b`. The query is jsonb containment,
  which the GIN index on the column serves.

  Check what merging `incoming` into `current` would produce, wording the

  `check/1` alone would blame an arbitrary key for the count: merging one new
  label into a conversation that already holds 32 puts a *pre-existing* key
  over the boundary in sorted order, and telling somebody their write of
  `run` failed because of `env` — a label they never touched — sends them to
  fix the wrong thing. So the count is reported against the first key this
  write adds.

  Entry-level problems need no such care: `current` is already on the row and

  Merge the labels an agent stamped on its own run over the ACP extension

  Unscoped, hence the prefix: it takes a bare conversation id and writes to

  caller is `Fountain.Conversations.TurnMachine`, running inside the
  conversation's own `ConversationServer`, holding the id that server was
  started with — so it cannot name another tenant's conversation, or another
  conversation of the same tenant. A request-shaped caller wants
  `Fountain.Conversations.set_conversation_labels/4`, which scopes by
  `user_id` and applies the sandbox rule.

  Recorded as `sprite` — code in the sandbox acting on the tenant's behalf
  (ADR 0013).

  refuse is logged and dropped, and so is one that raises on its way to the
