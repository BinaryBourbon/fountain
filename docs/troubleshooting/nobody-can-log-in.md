# Nobody can log in

This guide walks the chain from the most common cause to the least.

Note the symptom, because it misleads. Fountain accepts the password and the
session is real, but the user never leaves the "check your email" page. That
reads as a broken app, and not as a refused login.

## 1. Did the verification email go anywhere?

An instance with `EMAIL_DELIVERY=none` sends nothing, and that is the compose
default.

Verify an account by hand.

```bash
docker compose exec app bin/fountain_server eval \
  'Fountain.Release.verify_email("them@example.com")'
```

If that unblocks the account, the problem is mail. Read
[Configure email](../guides/operate/email.md).

## 2. You configured mail, and nothing arrives

The provider accepts mail from a domain that nobody verified. SPF, DKIM and
DMARC then fail downstream, and the receiver rejects the message or files it
as spam. Read the [mail integration guide](../integrations/mail.md).

## 3. OAuth still works when mail does not

A GitHub sign-in arrives already verified, so it is a way back in while mail
fails.

The reverse also holds. A GitHub outage breaks the button and nothing else.
Password auth still works.

## 4. A password reset needs mail that works

With `EMAIL_DELIVERY=none`, a locked-out password account has no self-serve
route back. That is the trade the mode's boot notice warns you about, and the
one route left is a release task.

## 5. 429 responses

The API rate limit is 600 requests each minute, for each IP.

If Fountain rate-limits *everyone* at once behind a proxy, `TRUSTED_PROXIES`
is unset. Each client then shares the proxy's bucket. Read
[Put it on the internet](../guides/operate/put-it-on-the-internet.md).
