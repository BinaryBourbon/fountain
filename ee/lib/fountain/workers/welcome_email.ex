defmodule Fountain.Workers.WelcomeEmail do
  @moduledoc """
  Sends the welcome email once a user's address is verified (#449).

  Enqueued only on the verification *transition* — the unverified branch of
  `EmailVerificationController.confirm/2` and the brand-new-user branch of the
  OAuth callback. Both fire at most once in an account's life, so once-per-user
  is structural; the `unique` window is the belt for a retried request. The
  "already verified" confirm branch deliberately does not enqueue, which is
  also what keeps accounts that predate this worker from being welcomed months
  after they signed up.
  """
