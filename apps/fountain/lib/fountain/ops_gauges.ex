defmodule Fountain.OpsGauges do
  @moduledoc """
  Periodic conversation / sandbox / Oban gauges (#321).

  Runs from the telemetry poller every 10s. Emits one datapoint per known
  status — including zeros — so every series exists from boot: an alert on
  `depth > N` needs the series to come back down to 0 on recovery rather
  than disappear, and a dashboard panel that only materializes during an
  incident is a panel nobody trusts.

  Oban states are the non-terminal ones plus `discarded`: `completed` and
  `cancelled` rows are unbounded history (Oban's Pruner owns them) and their
  count is not a queue-health signal. `discarded` is — a job that exhausted
  its retries failed permanently, and before this existed a nightly
  RetentionPruner or hourly SandboxReaper failure was invisible: Oban
  catches job exceptions internally, so nothing crashed and nothing paged.
