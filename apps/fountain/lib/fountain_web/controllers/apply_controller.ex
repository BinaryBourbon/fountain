        "Resources are reconciled in a fixed order — environments, vaults, agents, " <>
        "teammates, schedules, webhooks — so a spec may name another document " <>
        "whatever the file's order: an agent's `environment`, a teammate's " <>
        "`agent`, `environment` and `vault`, and a schedule's `teammate`. Every " <>
        "kind is keyed by the document's `name`, except `Webhook`, which is keyed " <>
        "by `spec.url`. A `Webhook` created here returns its signing secret once, " <>
        "on that result row. A `Teammate` is read as a whole declaration, so an " <>
        "absent `environment` or `vault` clears that binding, and moving either " <>
        "retires the computer the old binding named (refused with an error on " <>
        "that row while a turn is running on it). Two Teammate documents may not " <>
        "name the same agent. Apply is additive: a document dropped from the " <>
        "manifest leaves its record in place. Application is best-effort per " <>
        "resource: the response is 200 even when an individual resource fails " <>
